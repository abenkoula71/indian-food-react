# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in productionmode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is read to be deploye
See thesection about [deploymnt](https://facebook.github.io/create-rect-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
**Note: ths is  -wayoperation. Once you `eject`,
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your projec
Instead, it will copy al the cnfiuration filesand the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` wil still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use `ejec`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we derstan hat this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
